# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems Module

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides a high-level overview of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems module for humanoid robots. This module teaches how language, vision, and action are combined to control humanoid robots using AI.

## Module Structure
The VLA module consists of three concept-focused chapters:

### 1. Voice-to-Action Interfaces
- Learn how voice commands are processed by humanoid robots
- Understand OpenAI Whisper integration for speech-to-text
- Explore mapping voice input to specific robot actions

### 2. Cognitive Planning with LLMs
- Discover how natural language commands become action plans
- Learn about task decomposition for robotic applications
- Understand LLM-to-ROS 2 action pipeline implementation

### 3. Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid
- See end-to-end system architecture in action
- Understand navigation, perception, and manipulation flow integration
- Witness a simulated humanoid executing spoken commands

## Prerequisites
Before starting this module, students should be familiar with:
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Simulation environments
- Basic perception systems

## Getting Started
1. Begin with Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces to understand the foundation
2. Progress to Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs for advanced concepts
3. Complete with Chapter 3: The Autonomous Humanoid for system integration

## Key Concepts
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate perception, cognition, and action
- Voice commands flow through speech recognition → natural language understanding → action planning → robot execution
- LLMs enable complex task decomposition and cognitive planning
- End-to-end systems require integration of multiple subsystems

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Explain fundamental concepts of VLA systems for humanoid robots
- Describe the complete pipeline from voice command to robot action execution
- Understand how LLMs enable cognitive planning for robotic task execution
- Articulate integration flow between navigation, perception, and manipulation
- Demonstrate comprehension of language-to-action translation mechanisms
- Understand complete autonomous humanoid system architecture and flow
