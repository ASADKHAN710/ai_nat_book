# Vision-Language-Action Planning

## Prompt Text

```
- Add Module 4 to the Docusaurus docs, ensuring all chapter files are Markdown (.md) and included in the sidebar.

- Create three chapters covering Voice-to-Action, LLM-based planning, and the Autonomous Humanoid capstone, presented concept-first.
```

## Response Text

Successfully completed the planning phase for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module with the following artifacts:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Comprehensive plan outlining technical context, constitution check, gates, research, data model, and implementation approach for the VLA module

2. Research Document (research.md): Resolved all unknowns regarding Docusaurus configuration, content structure, and VLA system concepts

3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defined entities for modules, chapters, content sections, learning objectives, and navigation items

4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): High-level overview of the module structure and learning outcomes

The plan addresses all requirements from the user input, including adding the module to Docusaurus docs with Markdown files and proper sidebar integration. The three chapters covering Voice-to-Action, LLM-based planning, and Autonomous Humanoid capstone are structured with concept-first presentation as requested.

## Outcome

Planning phase complete with all required artifacts created. The implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for creating the VLA module documentation with proper integration into the Docusaurus site structure. Ready to proceed with task generation and implementation.
